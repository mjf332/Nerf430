# Nerf430
Nerf sentry gun using an MSP430. 

Included is a python script, which records keystrokes and sends them to an MSP430, which uses a radio module to communicate
to another MSP430 mounted onto an nerf "Vulcan" gun. This MSP430 then controlls a servo, and a darlington transistor inside 
the gun to fire it.
